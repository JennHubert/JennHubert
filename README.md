### âœ¨ Welcome! âœ¨

I am a data science graduate student at Stockton University with a political science background. I anticipate graduating mid-August. I am seeking to merge my data and political passions to support candidates, campaigns, and technologies I support. I am actively seeking opportunities to deepen my data and coordination skills for post-graduation.

Feel free to [connect](www.linkedin.com/in/jennhubert), and check out my other portfolios: [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.hubert) and [Portfolio Website](https://www.jennhubert.com)


I enjoy kayaking, riding my bike, and the occasional netflix binge.
