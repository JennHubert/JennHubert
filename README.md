### Hello!

I am currently in the Data Science Master's program at Stockton University. I recevied a Bachelors degree from Stockton as well. I am hoping to merge my data and political passions to help campaigns and candidates win their races.

I enjoy kayaking, riding my bike, and the occasional netflix binge.
