### ✨ Welcome! ✨

I am a data science graduate student at Stockton University with a political science background. I anticipate graduating mid-August. I am seeking to merge my data and political skillsets to support candidates, campaigns, and technologies I believe in. I am actively seeking opportunities to deepen my data skills.

I enjoy kayaking, bike riding, and the occasional netflix binge.
